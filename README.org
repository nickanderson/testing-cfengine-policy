#+title: Testing CFEngine Policy

Testing is an important part of the software life-cycle. Writing tests for your CFEngine policy can help to bring improved assurance that your policy behaves as expected. Follow along and write your first test policy.

When writing tests there are three or four basic stages that typically need to be handled:
- Initialization :: Set up the necessary conditions for the test, e.g. create some file's to be edited.
- Testing :: Running the policy whose behavior you wish to test.
- Checking :: Inspecting the results of the test policy to see if they conform with expectations.
- Cleanup :: You might need to cleanup artifacts produced by the test if your testing system does not handle it for you
